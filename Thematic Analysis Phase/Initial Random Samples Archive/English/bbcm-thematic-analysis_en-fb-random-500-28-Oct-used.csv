Simon Mijok Mijak, Minister of Roads and Bridges said the project will be funded through a grant from the Chinese government. ""This is a great day for the people of South Sudan and Greater Bahr El Ghazal and Western Bahr El Ghazal in particular, today we have signed a supplementary agreement on the implementation of Jur River bridge in Wau.

When the lives of 1.4 billion people were put under threat by the virus, China locked down Wuhan, once the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. But how did the virus spread throughout the city? And what led to the unprecedented lockdown? CGTN launches ""The Frontline: China's Fight Against COVID-19"", a 90-minute-long two-part documentary.

The Qixi Festival, a celebration of pure love and family reunion

Regarded as China’s Valentine’s Day, the Qixi Festival falls on the seventh day of the seventh month on the Chinese lunar calendar. Also widely known as Double Seventh Festival, the traditional festival takes place on Aug 25 this year.

Originating from over 2,000 years ago, the festival of love endured for such a long time because of the romantic legend behind the day.

The moving love story goes that Niulang, a cowherd, fell in love with Zhinv, a weaver fairy, and they got married. But later they were separated by the Silver River (the Milky Way), as their love was not allowed by the gods. They could only reunite once a year when a flock of magpies, which were deeply touched by their love, formed a bridge across the river.

This beautiful tale is told every year during the Qixi Festival to commemorate the couple’s eternal love. And for many young people in China, Niulang and Zhinv’s story is also a symbol of their own relationship, as lovers in long-distance relationships or couples that are busy with work have less time to reunite. To celebrate the reunion of Niulang and Zhinv is also a way to express people’s wishes for pure love.

Qixi Festival was added to China’s National Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2006. (With input from Xinhua and CGTN; Produced by Chen Zilin and Wang Han)","","Happy Chinese Valentine's Day.","chinainsa","link","","PAGE","chinainsa","159","","Chinese Embassy in South Africa","true","fb-chinainsa","434624170049878","['english', 'chinese', 'n/a']","434624170049878","2020-08-25T08:28:13.000Z","fb","fb-434624170049878","true","200","2781","","Main Facebook Page Link","false","https://www.facebook.com/chinainsa","","chinese_embassy_facebook_page_link"

However, Chinese scholars from a Xinjiang-based think tank, Xinjiang Development Research Center, found the so-called expert on Xinjiang is a far-right Christian, who is fabricating unfounded reports to slander China's policies in Xinjiang and cater to the US and some Western countries' aim of attacking China. Zenz's ""reports"" that have been cited and hyped by some Western media are full of lies, farfetched assumptions, and baseless accusations. Who is Adrian Zenz?

Zenz, born in 1974, is a German. He gives himself a Chinese name as Zheng Guoen. He used to work for the European School of Culture and Theology and went to China's Xinjiang in 2007 as a visitor. Starting in 2016, Zenz began commenting on China's Xinjiang, and wantonly slandering and distorting China's policies in the region. He made up more than 10 reports relating to Xinjiang, including one published in February titled The Karakax List: Dissecting the Anatomy of Beijing's Internment Drive in Xinjiang and another in July titled Sterilizations, IUDs, and Coercive Birth Prevention: The CCP's Campaign to Suppress Uyghur Birth Rates in Xinjiang. He also kept making sensational and unfounded accusations against China, including that around ""1 million Uygurs are illegally detained in Xinjiang,"" ""Xinjiang imposes birth control measures on Uygurs and minorities,"" and ""Xinjiang is having culture genocide on minorities."" Under the vehement support of the Western media, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, Zenz gained infamy on the anti-China stage and has been welcomed as ""an expert on Xinjiang."" He has received enthusiastic approval from anti-China politicians from the US and become a focal member of a research group on Xinjiang's vocational training and education center that was set up and controlled by a US intelligence agency.

Zenz's ""reports"" that have been cited and hyped by some Western media are full of lies, farfetched assumptions, and baseless accusations. Who is Adrian Zenz? Adrian Zenz, an evangelical ""scholar,"" has recently been making so-called reports on Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, aiming to slander China's policies in the region. Who is Adrian Zenz? What did he do to make the US and Western countries tout him as one of the ""leading"" experts studying China's Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Region? Zenz, born in 1974, is a German. He gives himself a Chinese name as Zheng Guoen. He used to work for the European School of Culture and Theology and went to China's Xinjiang in 2007 as a visitor. Starting in 2016, Zenz began commenting on China's Xinjiang, and wantonly slandering and distorting China's policies in the region. He made up more than 10 reports relating to Xinjiang, including one published in February titled The Karakax List: Dissecting the Anatomy of Beijing's Internment Drive in Xinjiang and another in July titled Sterilizations, IUDs, and Coercive Birth Prevention: The CCP's Campaign to Suppress Uyghur Birth Rates in Xinjiang. He also kept making sensational and unfounded accusations against China, including that around ""1 million Uygurs are illegally detained in Xinjiang,"" ""Xinjiang imposes birth control measures on Uygurs and minorities,"" and ""Xinjiang is having culture genocide on minorities."" Under the vehement support of the Western media, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, Zenz gained infamy on the anti-China stage and has been welcomed as ""an expert on Xinjiang."" He has received enthusiastic approval from anti-China politicians from the US and become a focal member of a research group on Xinjiang's vocational training and education center that was set up and controlled by a US intelligence agency. In recent years, Zenz has been busy in shuttling between the US Congress, European Parliament and Canadian Parliament, making groundless accusations against China's Xinjiang policies to incite attacks and pressure on China by using the so-called ""human rights problems of Uygurs."" In March, together with many US politicians and members of the ""East Turkistan"" separatists, Zenz attended an event themed ""China's Systematic Persecution of Uygurs"" at the United States (truncated)","chinaembd","link","","PAGE","chinaembd","112","","Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Bangladesh","true","fb-chinaembd","106507707486335","['bengali', 'n/a', 'n/a']","106507707486335","2020-08-20T15:33:47.000Z","fb","fb-106507707486335","true","200","3006","","Main Facebook Page Link","false","https://www.facebook.com/chinaembd","","chinese_embassy_facebook_page_link"

What is your comment on his remarks? Wang Wenbin: Pompeo and some other US politicians have been hyping up so-called “failed US engagement with China” and “failed US attempt to induce change inside of China”. In response to their comments, the Chinese side has made clear its position, and I’d like to stress the following points. First, the claim of “failed US engagement with China” disrespects history and facts. Over the past nearly five decades since China and the US resumed exchange and established diplomatic relations, the two sides have been expanding and deepening exchange and cooperation across the board, which greatly benefited people in both countries. According to statistics, China-US economic and trade relations support 2.6 million American jobs, and over 72,500 US companies have investments or business in China. In multilateral fora, China-US cooperation has benefited the two countries and the world, from handling regional hotspots to addressing global issues like counter-terrorism and non-proliferation. Second, the “US attempt to induce change inside of China” is doomed to fail. The path a country takes should be determined by its own people based on its cultural tradition and historical heritage. No force is entitled to negate the choice of other countries. In a world full of diversity, China and the US, despite their different social systems, can by all means peacefully co-exist. Third, driven by political needs, Pompeo and some others are negating previous US administrations’ China policy and the progress achieved in relations with China and attempting to stoke ideological confrontation. This has proven to be unpopular even in the US. Over the past few days, many former politicians, academics and media have questioned and criticized his remarks, pointing out his misconceptions on China, China-US relations and the US China policy objectives. This fact itself speaks volumes. I must stress that China-US relations bear on the well-being of the two peoples and world peace and stability. We urge the likes of Pompeo to renounce the obsolete Cold War mentality and ideological bias, look at China and China-US relations correctly, and immediately stop words and acts damaging Chinese interests and bilateral relations so as to create conditions for bringing this relationship back on track.","true","true","fb","2020-08-02T00:06:38.000Z","954566381547297_1291508741186391","Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin's Regular Press Conference on July 29, 2020 2020/07/29 The Paper: US Secretary of State Pompeo said in his speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library that “the old paradigm of blind engagement with China” failed, and this kind of engagement has not brought the kind of change inside of China that the US had hoped to induce.

Since then, it has gone through a glorious course of 93 years. ——The PLA is the people’s army that has steadfastly upheld the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Over the past 93 years, under the strong leadership of CPC, the PLA has shown great courage and fearlessness in fighting for the independence of the Chinese nation, liberation of the people and founding of the People’s Republic of China. It has made remarkable contribution to safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests.The PLA has always been a strong force to defend China’s development and social stability, providing effective safeguard for pursuing the two centenary goals and the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. It well deserves the name of the “Great Wall of steel”. ——The PLA is the people’s army that has always maintained flesh-and-blood ties with the people. Deeply rooted in the Chinese people, the PLA is from the people, by the people, and for the people. Either in the years of revolutionary wars or in the new journey of social economic development, reform and opening up, the PLA has firmly adhered to the fundamental goal of serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly, always stood closely with the people. Whenever it is in need, the PLA always provides support in the shortest time. After the COVID-19 outbreak in China early this year, the PLA rapidly deployed over 10,000 military medical personnel to combat the virus; in the face of recent severe floods that hit China, tens of thousands of PLA troops are fighting on the front lines to protect people’s lives and properties. ——The PLA is the people’s army that has always been committed to safeguarding world peace and stability. Following the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, the PLA has faithfully honored its international responsibilities and obligations, played important roles in the the UN peacekeeping operations, on escort missions in the Gulf of Aden, and in international humanitarian relief operations. During the globe pandemic of COVID 19, the PLA has dispatched medical expert teams to the most severely hit countries, provided medical material assistance to many foreign armies, contributing to the global solidarity against the pandemic. This year also marks the 30th anniversary of China’s participation in UN peacekeeping operations. China is now the largest troop contributing country among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and the main funding contributor to the UN peacekeeping operations. So far, China has dispatched over 40,000 troops to 25 UN peacekeeping missions with 15 soldiers sacrificed their lives while on duty. At present, more than 1,000 Chinese peacekeepers are deployed in UN mission in South Sudan. They help South Sudanese people build roads and bridges, maintain law and order, provide medical services to the locals and actively participate in social welfare activities. The Chinese peacekeepers has won the trust of all sides for their dedication, discipline and professionalism. In the past hundred of years, China had also experienced turmoils and sufferings, so we deeply empathize with the suffer of the South Sudanese people. Over the years, China has been constructively participating in the peace process of South Sudan. China supports the mediation efforts of IGAD and the African Union to promote peace in South Sudan. We have provided in-kind aids to support South Sudanese side to implement the R-ARCSS, especially for the process of unification of force; we have continuously carried out humanitarian assistance to support South Sudan’s economic and social development.

Over the years, China has been constructively participating in the peace process of South Sudan. China supports the mediation efforts of IGAD and the African Union to promote peace in South Sudan. We have provided in-kind aids to support South Sudanese side to implement the R-ARCSS, especially for the process of unification of force; we have continuously carried out humanitarian assistance to support South Sudan’s economic and social development. Peace is the foundation of development, while development is the guarantee for peace. We sincerely congratulate the important progress made in South Sudan’s peace process and hope all the parties concerned will continue to unite and push forward the momentum of peace for the interests of South Sudanese people and nation’s future; and to greet the second decade of South Sudan’s independence with a new look. As early as two thousand years ago, the Chinese recognized that “though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin”. The Chinese nation has always loved peace. Since the founding of People’s Republic of China, it has never started any war or conflict. China has voluntarily downsized the PLA by more than 4 million troops since 1980. The development of China’s national defense aims to meet its rightful security needs and contribute to the growth of the world’s peaceful forces. China will never follow the beaten track of big powers in seeking hegemony; on the contrary, China advocates that the world’s major powers should avoid falling into the self-fulfilled (truncated)","chinaemb.ss","link","","PAGE","chinaemb.ss","160","","Chinese Embassy in South Sudan","true","fb-chinaemb.ss","1732084740270235","['english', 'n/a', 'n/a']","1732084740270235","2020-07-31T08:44:13.000Z","fb","fb-1732084740270235","true","200","3952","","Main Facebook Page Link","false","https://www.facebook.com/chinaemb.ss","","chinese_embassy_facebook_page_link"

The Ministry also made specific requirements on the ceasing of all operations and events by the Consulate General. On 21 July, the US launched a unilateral provocation by abruptly demanding that China close its Consulate General in Houston. The US move seriously breached international law, the basic norms of international relations, and the terms of the China-US Consular Convention. It gravely harmed China-US relations. The measure taken by China is a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified act by the US.

He tried his best to draw forced analogies, speak on hearsay evidence, confuse right with wrong, to attack and smear China, deliberately driving a wedge between China-Myanmar cooperation and bilateral relations. The spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar makes a statement exposing and refuting the U.S. side's selfish, hypocritical, contemptible and ugly face. The spokesperson points out that for a period of time, the U.S. has been pursuing the so-called America First Policy. It ignores international ethics and legal norms, disregards the common interests of mankind and international trends, and has done a lot of disgusting things. In order to contain China, U.S. agencies abroad are ordered to attack and smear China. Now the U.S. Embassy in Myanmar has also extended a dirty hand to the Chinese side. The article of the U.S. Embassy is full of dirty loopholes and shoddy work to the extent that is shocking. With extremely unreasonable logic, the article links Myanmar with Hong Kong and the South China Sea issues, and even with the democracy and sovereignty issues flaunted by the United States in order to defame China-Myanmar relations, bilateral cooperation and anti-pandemic assistance. This only suggests that the U.S. agencies abroad have done whatever they could think of to attack China. Under the current international situation, the reasons why the article outrageously smearing China and sowing discords between China and Myanmar are thought-provoking. This not only reflects the ""sour grapes"" mindset of the United States towards the flourishing China-Myanmar relations but also another farce on a global tour by the U.S. authorities to shift the attention on domestic problems and seek selfish political gains. Know your own faults before blaming others for theirs. The U.S. should first look in the mirror to see whether it still looks like a major country now. The U.S. has overstepped the bottom line of international relations, promotes egoism, unilateralism and bullying, ignores international rules and international moral responsibilities, frantically withdraws from important international organizations, undermines international cooperation, refuses to perform major country’s responsibilities, and endangers international peace and security. The U.S. has overstepped the bottom line of regional cooperation by downgrading the level of delegates attending the ASEAN summits for consecutive years, paying lip service in the cooperation with ASEAN and Myanmar, constantly playing up the South China Sea issue and disrupting the regional peace and stability. The U.S. has overstepped the bottom line in domestic governance. Based on ""Political Self-interest First"" and ""Vote First"", the U.S. has missed the pandemic prevention and control window period time and time again, causing the number of daily infections to continuously strike new highs. The U.S. did not introspect itself. Instead, it has been shifting the blame frantically to China globally, in an attempt to deflect domestic attention and justify its negligence and dereliction of duty. In U.S., racial discrimination, the gap between the rich and the poor, political disunity and other social problems have become prominent, none of which has been seriously resolved. As the Chinese idiom goes, covering one’s ears whilst stealing a bell. How could U.S. expect to cover up its own scars by slandering and discrediting China? The U.S. has regained the notorious “McCarthyist bigotry” and outdated “Cold War mindset” on its current China policy, and deliberately stoked ideological oppositions, breaking through the baseline of international law and basic norms of international relations. China will never be driven by a few American anti-China forces, and will firmly defend its legitimate interests and dignity. Hong Kong is China's territory. It is entirely China's internal affairs for the Chinese government to plug the loopholes in national security and issue the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). In order to continue to use Hong Kong to engage in anti-China actions, the U.S. repeatedly and maliciously slanders and discredits the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR, and even insists on signing the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Bill into law.

Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and the U.S. has no right to make irresponsible remarks. On the South China Sea issue, the U.S. breaks its public commitment of not taking a position on the South China Sea sovereignty issue.

During the past four decades, Uyghur population in Xinjiang more than doubled from 5.55 million to 11.68 million. There is one mosque for every 530 Muslims in Xinjiang, and the total number of mosques is 10 times more than that in the US. People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang lead happy lives. They can breathe freely. Has the US side ever seen such ""ethnic repression""? The US also falsely claims that Muslims in Xinjiang live under close surveillance and that more than one million CPC cadres live in Uyghur homes. The truth is, a ""Pair Up and Become Family"" program has been carried out in Xinjiang, bringing officials to communities to help people address difficulties in employment, education and medical services. In over three years, more than 987 million yuan and 51.12 million articles have been donated and 18.77 million cases that bear on local people's immediate interests and welfare have been properly tended to. The program has been warmly received by people of various ethnic groups. It is a concrete example showing the deep bond between the CPC and the Chinese people and the Chinese government putting people first with its down-to-earth approach. The US politicians who don't care for people's welfare and only care about their own political gains surely cannot understand this. Let's look at the situation in the United States. Racial and ethnic minorities in the US have long been the targets of bullying, exclusion, and widespread and systemic discrimination in the political, economic, cultural and social aspects of their lives. Take Native Americans as an example. For quite a long period of time, the US government had been enforcing a policy of genocide, segregation and assimilation against Native Americans. For nearly a century after its founding, the US was uprooting and killing American Indians in its Westward Movement. The Native American population plunged from 5 million to 0.25 million in the early 20th century. It now accounts for a mere 2 percent of the US population. Another example, African Americans. African Americans have a COVID-19 infection rate five times that of white Americans, and a much higher mortality rate as well. This highlights the racial inequality in the US. The recent death of an African American George Floyd and the massive protests that followed once again shows that the systemic racial discrimination in the US has reached a point where racial and ethnic minorities ""can't breathe"". This is truly heartbreaking.","true","true","fb","2020-07-16T08:35:00.000Z","104493884371364_184446106376141","China's latest response to the US's maliciously attacks on the Chinese Government's Xinjiang policy Facts speak louder than words.

False: The legislation on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong will undermine the human rights and basic freedoms of Hong Kong residents, and violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. True: ◆The Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region clearly stipulates that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, which the residents of the Region enjoy under the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. ◆The legislation only targets four types of offences, namely, secession, subversion, terrorist activities and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security. It is designed to deter and sanction a small minority in Hong Kong who are involved in offences seriously jeopardizing national security. It aims to protect the great majority of law-abiding Hong Kong residents, and safeguard their safety and lawful rights and freedoms. ◆It is spelt out in the constitutions of over 100 countries that the exercise of basic rights and freedoms shall not endanger national security. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights makes it clear that freedoms of religious belief, expression and peaceful assembly, the right to public trial and other rights may be subject to restrictions that are necessary to protect national security, public order and so on. There are similar provisions in the European Convention on Human Rights. 2. False: The legislation on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong may include vaguely defined offences, and be abused by China’s national security authorities to oppress the people. True: ◆The legislation only targets four types of offences that seriously jeopardize national security, much less than the dozens of crimes involving national security listed in countries such as the US and the UK. The legislation sets clear limits on related law enforcement activities. It requires that all law enforcement efforts be conducted in strict accordance with legal provisions and statutory mandates and procedures, without prejudice to the lawful rights and interests of any individual or organization.

A: As the epidemic continues to spread, the world has witnessed rapidly rising demands and a widening supply gap of ventilators. Including the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain, countries with a large number of confirmed cases have been struggling to meet their demands by purchasing globally and expanding production domestically. Why are ventilators so critical in the treatment of COVID-19 patients? Breathing difficulties are one of the clinical symptoms of severe COVID-19 patients. When the new coronavirus attacks patients’ lungs, complications such as pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) may occur. According to the Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) released by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), in severe cases, patients present dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within one week after onset and some of them may rapidly deteriorate to ARDS. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that about 13% of confirmed cases turned critically ill and could have breathing difficulties. In such cases, using instruments to support or replace breathing is the only solution. Ventilators are vital medical devices in improving human respiratory function. During the process of inhalation, lung volume increases and alveoli expands as a result of the contraction of respiratory muscles. Then inhalation occurs because of the pressure gradient between atmosphere and thoracic cavity. In contrast, during exhalation, respiratory muscles relax and alveoli contracts. Then exhalation happens due to increased pressure within the thoracic cavity. When patients encounter breathing difficulties, ventilators can help achieve the pressure gradient, thus replacing, controlling or changing patients’ breathing. Ventilators can be divided into two categories. In non-invasive ventilation, patients receive breathing support through a face mask, nasal mask or a helmet. If the condition does not improve or gets worse, tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be performed timely. Ventilators play a significant role in reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19. To date, there is still no “wonder drug” in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Wang Yi: China and Africa are good brothers who have shared weal and woe together. Our people, having fought shoulder-to-shoulder for national liberation, are partners for common development. A few years back, we were together fighting Ebola. I fully agree with the AU Commission Chairperson in saying that ""Africa and China are friends and, more importantly, comrades-in-arms. Nothing can change or damage this friendship"". In the battle against COVID-19, China and Africa have again stood by each other. Over 50 African leaders have expressed solidarity and support in phone calls or public statements. China has subsequently sent medical expert teams to Africa's five sub-regions and surrounding countries. Resident Chinese medical teams based in 45 African countries have acted swiftly to assist in the local response. They have held nearly 400 training sessions for tens of thousands of African medical workers. We also look after the African community in China just like we take care of our own families. All of the over 3,000 African students in Hubei and Wuhan have been safe and sound, except for just one who got infected but was soon cured. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). China's relations with Africa have stood the test of time and continue to flourish. We will continue to stand by Africa as it fights the virus. We will send anti-epidemic assistance to African and other developing countries as a matter of priority. We are considering sending more medical expert teams to the continent. China will continue to deliver on the health initiative announced at the FOCAC Beijing Summit. We will accelerate construction of the Africa CDC headquarters, and help boost public health capacity in African nations. In addition, China will continue to work with Africa on development capacity-building. We will work out ways to move ahead with major ongoing cooperation projects and support African countries in reopening businesses soon to sustain Africa's economic momentum. We will work with other G20 members to implement the debt service suspension initiative to ease Africa's debt burden. We are also considering further bilateral support for African countries under the greatest strain to help our African brothers and sisters through this difficult time.

Any sparkles? You’ll be disappointed again!
It’s festival season when pigs are slaughtered
 in nearly every household in the countryside, 
for cold smoking waxed meat and sausages.
Freezing days are best with pig maw and pepper chicken casserole in Hakka tradition
to go with Lap Mei claypot rice, plus pork liver stir-fried in salted egg yolks.
What a divine combination!

He also said there are many labs operated by the CPC and it's not the first time such risk arose. I wonder if you have a comment? Hua Chunying: In recent months the MFA regular press conference has basically become a platform to dispel the rumors spread by Mr. Pompeo. Regarding the so-called leak of virus from the lab in Wuhan, what I have seen is that almost all leading scientists and experts in disease control in the world, including top expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, have openly rejected Mr. Pompeo's comments. But he is sticking to his old lies. We have asked this question more than once: Where is the evidence he keeps talking about? Just show us if there's any! As to the Wuhan P4 laboratory, as I've said, it was born out of cooperation between the Chinese and French governments, that its design, construction and management all follow international standards, that its first group of researchers were trained at P4 labs in France and the US, and its facilities and equipment are tested annually by a third party agency accredited by the state. Committed to timely and openly sharing scientific and research information, the P4 laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), as one of the several dozens of P4 labs around the world, has been carrying out cooperation and exchanges with others. Last year, it received over 70 visits by people from all over the world. Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance and prominent virus expert who has been cooperating with the WIV for 15 years, said in an April 26 interview that there is no virus in the Wuhan lab that could trigger the outbreak. Since Mr. Pompeo cannot stop attacking China and spewing lies, then I am left with no options but going through some old stories on the US side. For the record, all these stories were reported by the US media. They are neither disinformation nor recrimination. I hope our media friends will keep this in mind and refrain from making random accusations. According to open records we have access to, China has only two P4 labs, the highest biosafety level lab, while the US has 13 that are either in operation, under expansion or in planning, according to a February report by the Federation of American Scientists. The US also has 1495 P3 labs, not including many other labs it built in the territory of the former Soviet Union, like in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and in many other places around the world. One more fact you need to know: the US has been the only country that blocks the resumption of negotiation on a verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention. A USA TODAY Network investigation reveals that since 2003, hundreds of lab incidents have occurred in the US biological laboratories where humans had accidental contact with deadly pathogens. The person with direct contact may get infected, which will spread to people or animals in the surrounding community and cause an epidemic. According to a 2009 report by the US General Accounting Office, in the past decade, P3 labs in the US had 400 accidents. The biolabs in the US now pose the biggest safety risk to the US regulatory authority. The US sets up 16 labs in Ukraine. Large-scale measles once erupted in some places where these labs located. The latest example is that last July, the bio-chemical research base at Fort Detrick, Maryland, the largest research center for biochemical weapons in the US, was abruptly shut down by the US CDC, citing a failure of the Army laboratory to ""implement and maintain containment procedures sufficient to contain select agents or toxins"" . When reporting this story, USA Today said that this is a normal state and some risks might be brewing. There are also reports that soon after the closure, EVALI broke out in the surroundings. According to data released by the US CDC in late February, the flu season that begins in the winter of 2019 has infected at least 32 million people in the United States, including 18,000 deaths from flu-related illnesses. CDC Director Michael Redfield has publicly acknowledged that some of the deaths from influenza were actually caused by COVID-19. These are all public records in US media reports available online. We also noted that there is growing skepticism in response to these doubts. Calls have been growing in the United States and internationally for the US government to disclose the reasons for the closure of the Fort Detrick biological base and to find out the relationship between the closure of the base and EVALI, the influenza season, and the COVID-19 outbreak. Hasn't the US always demanded an open and transparent investigation? China has always been open and transparent in releasing information on epidemic prevention and control.

Le Yucheng expounded on the Chinese side's stances on such issues as China's efforts and experience in fighting the COVID-19, international cooperation in fighting the epidemic and relations between China and the United States, and also refuted the conspiracy theories such as the so-called ""China responsibility theory,"" ""China's cover-up theory"" and the stigmatization of China. The following is a transcript of the interview: Le Yucheng: First of all, it's my pleasure to do this interview with you. It is my first interview with a foreign media during this COVID-19 situation. I worked in New York for nearly four years, and I feel really sad when I see the once bustling Times Square, Broadway and Fifth Avenue have become so empty these days. So I want to take this opportunity to convey through NBC my heartfelt sympathies to the Americans and New Yorkers when they are in the fierce fight against the virus. This morning, I woke up to learn from the news that the US has nearly one million COVID-19 cases. I feel very sad to know this. Now at this critical and trying moment, China and the US must put aside all the differences, all the disagreements, just forget them, and join hands to confront our common enemy, the virus. I believe that together we will win and together we will make a big difference for the world. That's my opening remarks. Janis Frayer: To follow your opening remarks, do you believe we are now in a situation where the virus has become too politicized? Le Yucheng: Unfortunately, some politicians have gravely politicized the COVID-19 issue. This is not something we want to see. Under the current circumstances, it is the time for solidarity, for working together to combat the virus and tide over the difficulties. It is not a time for accusation and political manipulation. Janis Frayer: This is a time when people are calling for transparency on all sides. Can you take us back to the beginning of the time line here in China, the early days of when the cases were first being acknowledged by the CDC officials in Wuhan to when the lock down happened in Wuhan. What was happening within China's government during that period? Take us inside. Le Yucheng: China has been open, transparent and responsible in its COVID-19 response. We did not cover up anything, and did not delay any efforts. We have already publicized the time line of how we have shared the information on COVID-19. I would like to highlight three important points in time: First, 3 January. Starting from then, China has been updating the WHO and relevant countries, including the United States, about COVID-19 on a regular basis. On the following day, the heads of CDCs of China and the United States touched base with each other. The second one was 12 January. China timely shared with the world the whole genome sequencing of the coronavirus, which has been critical for diagnosis, treatment and vaccine development in relevant countries. The third one was 23 January. We put Wuhan, a city of over 10 million people, under quarantine. That was a momentous decision that was unseen before in our history. It was a massive action that has caught the world's attention. The US government should have become fully aware of the severity of the issue. If it were anything less serious, how could we lock down an entire city? As for the early stage of China's COVID-19 response, we invited a WHO-led joint expert mission for a field visit in China, which included two US medical experts. The group went to Beijing, Guangzhou, Sichuan and Hubei. Following the visit, it released a comprehensive report which gives full recognition to China's response efforts. President Trump himself, during his phone call with President Xi Jinping and in his tweets, spoke highly of China's transparency and response efforts. He said that the data China shared was helpful for the US in COVID-19 response. Janis Frayer: The US intelligence has suggested that China has artificially lowered the case numbers and the deaths and there were multiple revisions to the way that China was counting for coronavirus cases. So is it understandable that there is some skepticism about the numbers that China has been reporting and whether they are real? Le Yucheng: You mentioned US intelligence services. As is known to all, for more than once what they said caused disasters to the world. It was the US intelligence which claimed that Iraq had ""weapons of mass destruction"", yet till this day those weapons are nowhere to be found. China has been open, transparent, with good faith, and truthful when it comes to the release of data. We bear in mind our responsibility to history, to the people and to the lives lost to COVID-19. What we've done can stand scrutiny. There is no need for cover-ups. This is all about real people.

Janis Frayer: The US intelligence has suggested that China has artificially lowered the case numbers and the deaths and there were multiple revisions to the way that China was counting for coronavirus cases.

It is literally (truncated)","","On April 28, 2020, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng gave an exclusive television interview to Janis Frayer, a senior correspondent with NBC News based in Beijing. Le Yucheng expounded on the Chinese side's stances on such issues as China's efforts and experience in fighting the COVID-19, international cooperation in fighting the epidemic and relations between China and the United States, and also refuted the conspiracy theories such as the so-called ""China responsibility theory,"" ""China's cover-up theory"" and the stigmatization of China. The following is a transcript of the interview: Le Yucheng: First of all, it's my pleasure to do this interview with you. It is my first interview with a foreign media during this COVID-19 situation. I worked in New York for nearly four years, and I feel really sad when I see the once bustling Times Square, Broadway and Fifth Avenue have become so empty these days. So I want to take this opportunity to convey through NBC my heartfelt sympathies to the Americans and New Yorkers when they are in the fierce fight against the virus. This morning, I woke up to learn from the news that the US has nearly one million COVID-19 cases. I feel very sad to know this. Now at this critical and trying moment, China and the US must put aside all the differences, all the disagreements, just forget them, and join hands to confront our common enemy, the virus. I believe that together we will win and together we will make a big difference for the world. That's my opening remarks. Janis Frayer: To follow your opening remarks, do you believe we are now in a situation where the virus has become too politicized? Le Yucheng: Unfortunately, some politicians have gravely politicized the COVID-19 issue. This is not something we want to see. Under the current circumstances, it is the time for solidarity, for working together to combat the virus and tide over the difficulties. It is not a time for accusation and political manipulation. Janis Frayer: This is a time when people are calling for transparency on all sides. Can you take us back to the beginning of the time line here in China, the early days of when the cases were first being acknowledged by the CDC officials in Wuhan to when the lock down happened in Wuhan. What was happening within China's government during that period? Take us inside. Le Yucheng: China has been open, transparent and responsible in its COVID-19 response. We did not cover up anything, and did not delay any efforts. We have already publicized the time line of how we have shared the information on COVID-19. I would like to highlight three important points in time: First, 3 January. Starting from then, China has been updating the WHO and relevant countries, including the United States, about COVID-19 on a regular basis. On the following day, the heads of CDCs of China and the United States touched base with each other. The second one was 12 January. China timely shared with the world the whole genome sequencing of the coronavirus, which has been critical for diagnosis, treatment and vaccine development in relevant countries. The third one was 23 January. We put Wuhan, a city of over 10 million people, under quarantine. That was a momentous decision that was unseen before in our history. It was a massive action that has caught the world's attention. The US government should have become fully aware of the severity of the issue. If it were anything less serious, how could we lock down an entire city? As for the early stage of China's COVID-19 response, we invited a WHO-led joint expert mission for a field visit in China, which included two US medical experts. The group went to Beijing, Guangzhou, Sichuan and Hubei. Following the visit, it released a comprehensive report which gives full recognition to China's response efforts. President Trump himself, during his phone call with President Xi Jinping and in his tweets, spoke highly of China's transparency and response efforts. He said that the data China shared was helpful for the US in COVID-19 response. Janis Frayer: The US intelligence has suggested that China has artificially lowered the case numbers and the deaths and there were multiple revisions to the way that China was counting for coronavirus cases. So is it understandable that there is some skepticism about the numbers that China has been reporting and whether they are real? Le Yucheng: You mentioned US intelligence services.

The first reason was the need to control the source of infection. Before the lockdown, Wuhan witnessed a notable increase of patients with fever. The healthcare system in Wuhan was already under great pressure, and the fever clinics, outpatient services, and emergency rooms were severely overloaded. The outbreak in Wuhan had spread to other parts of Hubei Province and the country as most reported cases of COVID-19 across the country could be traced back to the city. The second reason was the need to cut the chains of transmission. Along with the Spring Festival migration, the epidemic could spread across the country via Wuhan and Hubei Province. The outbreak started before the Lunar New Year holiday, when a great number of people in China would travel across the country for family reunions and tourism. As a centrally located transportation hub for roads, railways, waterways, and aviation in China, Wuhan was a typical transfer station for various passengers. It was estimated that in January 2020 transportation services in the city would serve about 15 million passengers during the holiday period. The lockdown of Wuhan, including transportation closures and inbound and outbound travel restrictions, was imposed to stop the epidemic from spreading nationwide through interregional transportation. Experts and scholars including Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, commented that the Wuhan lockdown reduced the possibility of the epidemic's further spreading, and that the measures taken were very appropriate and highly important. Last but not least, the reason was the need to react to the uncertainty as well. Based on the judgement of China’s COVID-19 Expert Team and the High-level Expert Group of the National Health Commission (NHC), the only certainty about the COVID-19 was the human-to-human transmission. There were many uncertainties about understanding of the epidemic situation, such as what the route and mechanism of human-to-human transmission are, what the exact fatality rate is, who the susceptible groups are, how many people have been infected. Furthermore, the quick development of the epidemic brought unprecedented challenges for the prevention and control of the disease. The lockdown was to reduce the damage caused by the epidemic at large.","true","true","fb","2020-04-19T12:57:50.000Z","954566381547297_1205215863149013","P06: Tanbasá mak Xina impoin lockdown/blokeadu iha Wuhan?

The first reason was the need to control the source of infection. Before the lockdown, Wuhan witnessed a notable increase of patients with fever. The healthcare system in Wuhan was already under great pressure, and the fever clinics, outpatient services, and emergency rooms were severely overloaded. The outbreak in Wuhan had spread to other parts of Hubei Province and the country as most reported cases of COVID-19 across the country could be traced back to the city. The second reason was the need to cut the chains of transmission. Along with the Spring Festival migration, the epidemic could spread across the country via Wuhan and Hubei Province. The outbreak started before the Lunar New Year holiday, when a great number of people in China would travel across the country for family reunions and tourism. As a centrally located transportation hub for roads, railways, waterways, and aviation in China, Wuhan was a typical transfer station for various passengers. It was estimated that in January 2020 transportation services in the city would serve about 15 million passengers during the holiday period. The lockdown of Wuhan, including transportation closures and inbound and outbound travel restrictions, was imposed to stop the epidemic from spreading nationwide through interregional transportation. Experts and scholars including Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, commented that the Wuhan lockdown reduced the possibility of the epidemic's further spreading, and that the measures taken were very appropriate and highly important. Last but not least, the reason was the need to react to the uncertainty as well. Based on the judgement of China’s COVID-19 Expert Team and the High-level Expert Group of the National Health Commission (NHC), the only certainty about the COVID-19 was the human-to-human transmission. There were many uncertainties about understanding of the epidemic situation, such as what the route and mechanism of human-to-human transmission are, what the exact fatality rate is, who the susceptible groups are, how many people have been infected. Furthermore, the quick development of the epidemic brought unprecedented challenges for the prevention and control of the disease. The lockdown was to reduce the damage caused by the epidemic at large.","","P06: Tanbasá mak Xina impoin lockdown/blokeadu iha Wuhan? Q06: Why did China impose a lockdown on Wuhan?

Two of the officials also said that the report concluded that China's numbers were not real. Do yo have any comment on this? Hua Chunying: As a Bloomberg reporter, you must be well aware of recent US media reports on the epidemic situation at home and the administration's response. When you raised this question, I believe you already had an answer in your mind and just wanted to get it confirmed. I noted many US media's reports on what you mentioned. US Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo said similar things on April 1 to accuse China of covering up the epidemic. They even claimed that China was dealing with the epidemic in December more than a month earlier before the world learned about it. My colleagues and I have been elaborating on all the details of China's response, which shows clearly that China has been giving open, transparent and timely updates to the world. I believe you may have drawn the same conclusion based on the daily information released by the Chinese government. On international public health security, we should listen to WHO and experts on epidemiology and disease control rather than several politicians who are habitual liars. In fact, just yesterday, a senior WHO official refuted unwarranted accusations on ""China's untransparent data"" in a press conference in Geneva. We sympathize with the US people as they are facing a severe situation, and I can imagine why some in the US are trying so hard to shift the blame. We don't want to get into any meaningless argument with them. But in response to their endless, immoral slanders, I feel I have no choice but to take a few moments to clarify the truth once again. It is true that Wuhan was where COVID-19 cases were first reported. But where and when exactly did this virus originate? We read many recent reports and findings on that. There are articles written by medical professionals from Italy, the UK, the US, Australia and other countries, which are published in top academic journals including Nature Medicine. On the origin of the virus, the Chinese government's position has been consistent. It is a serious matter that requires scientific, fact-based and professional assessment made by experts. Now there are various reports on experts' science-based and authoritative opinions. These views should be valued and respected by all, including those politicians in the US. China invited WHO experts to visit Wuhan as part of a joint mission. As some in the US are so obsessed with the issue, we advise the US side to also invite WHO and international experts to visit the country and find out the truth. The timeline of China's response is very clear, as you can gather from media reports. On December 27, 2019, Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care at Hubei Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, reported the first three suspected cases. On December 29, Hubei and Wuhan health committees instructed related centers for disease control and prevention and hospitals to carry out epidemiological investigation. On December 30 Wuhan Municipal Health Committee issued an ""urgent notice on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause"". On December 31, the NHC sent an expert group to Wuhan to investigate on site. On January 3, 2020, China started to send timely updates to WHO and other countries, including the US. On January 8, the pathogen was preliminarily identified. On January 11, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention uploaded five whole genome sequences of the novel coronavirus on the GISAID website and shared data with the world and WHO. On January 23, Wuhan was put under lockdown and unprecedented comprehensive, thorough and rigorous measures were adopted. By taking these decisive and strong measures, the Chinese government ensured to the highest possible extent the life, safety and health of the Chinese people and bought precious time for stemming the global spread of the virus. As I said yesterday, the journal Science published a paper by researchers in the United States, the UK and other countries saying that China's control measures worked by successfully breaking the chain of transmission and bought other countries valuable time. Recently Dr. Fauci, the medical expert leading the White House effort to contain the coronavirus, reportedly said he refused to let others push him to say that China should warn the US three months beforehand, because it just doesn't comport with facts.

The Deputy Director of Africa CDC, Ahmed E. Ogwell Ouma, told Xinhua that the video conference is a good example that the Chinese government has placed its experience on the table for Africa countries to be able to see and use in the fight against the epidemic. “We are very impressed by the reduction in the numbers; and we think in a short while the outbreak should be declared finished in China,” he said, “The experience that China has undergone is very important for us, because our is just starting, while in China it is ending. That experience is very important.”","bw.chineseembassy","link","","PAGE","bw.chineseembassy","116","","中国驻博茨瓦纳大使馆 Chinese Embassy in Botswana","true","fb-bw.chineseembassy","838988326148968","['english', 'n/a', 'n/a']","838988326148968","2020-03-19T10:02:05.000Z","fb","fb-838988326148968","true","200","21345","","Main Facebook Page Link","false","https://www.facebook.com/bw.chineseembassy","","chinese_embassy_facebook_page_link"

We believe that exchanging views helps people understand each other better. We would like to make further comments: Epidemics run through the human history. The emergence of a virus has nothing to do with a specific political system. Epidemics could emerge in any society and spread regardless of race or ideology. Linking infectious diseases to a political system is scientifically untenable and politically harmful. However the prevention and control of the fatal epidemics are associated with the institutional system and governance capacity. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19, China took its institutional advantages to organize a concerted, comprehensive, inter-agency response for disease control as well as supporting Hubei, the most-affected province where more than 10 million people have sacrificed their normal life for virus prevention. At the same time, more than 30,000 medical staff, a large number of daily necessities and medical supplies were mobilized to Hubei from across the country. In this rare and unusual period, the social order of Hubei remains stable and people's daily life is guaranteed. It wasn't easy, but China made it. Without a strong leadership and an efficient social system, this would be a mission impossible. Although the time to relax vigilance is yet to come, encouragingly these efforts have paid off in a short time. For days, the total number of newly confirmed cases outside Hubei has remained in single digits. ""Zero case reports"" are registered in most provinces and the situation in Hubei Province has also been significantly improved. With above-mentioned achievements, the value of China’s political system speaks for itself. The great sacrifices made by the Chinese people, especially the people in Hubei, have been widely praised by the international community. Leaders from more than 160 countries and 30 international organisations have expressed their sympathy and support to China. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his gratitude to all the people in China who are suffering in their daily life for preventing more transmission and are making contributions to the world. WHO Assistant Director-General Bruce Aylward said China has taken ""differentiated approach"",which has prevented or at least delayed hundreds of thousands of new cases. To the people in Wuhan, it is recognized that the world is in your debt. The Covid-19 is new to us all and its research is still in the early stage. It takes time to know it. Soon after identifying the virus, China took rapid prevention and control measures, promptly informed the WHO and shared the virus DNA sequence with other countries, based on which, Singapore developed a diagnostic test kit within a short period of time and donated some of them to China. This cooperation greatly improved the capabilities of both countries to fight the disease. The epidemic will eventually end. It will never be an ""inflection point"" on China's way forward, but a new ""starting point"". The Chinese people will unite closely around the CPC Central Committee with General Secretary Xi Jinping at the core,and strive hard to modernize the system and capacity for governance， including public health system. We will continue to strengthen cooperation with the international community in an open manner and work together to create a community of shared future for mankind. We know that misinterpretation, prejudices and challenges against China will be there and probably along with the whole process of China's rise. China is a big country with a huge population of 1.4 billion. There is no ready-made model to copy. We welcome people who are interested in China to visit the country more often, and hopefully some prejudices could be changed by what you see. 中国驻新加坡大使馆注意到网友对我馆发言人于2月25日发表谈话的评论，其中包括比拉哈里先生的回应。我们相信讨论有助于大家进一步看清事实。就此，使馆发言人再次发表以下谈话： 与病毒的斗争贯穿整个人类发展史，病毒的出现与政治制度没有关联。任何制度下都会出现病毒，它的传播也不分国家种族和意识形态。把传染病与制度挂钩，在科学上不成立，在政治上是有害的。 但是防控病毒同一个国家的制度体系和治理能力有关。新型冠状病毒肺炎爆发以来，中国发挥了举国体制的制度优势，在全国范围内建立防控机制，并发动全社会力量支援疫情最为严重的湖北地区。在湖北，1000多万居民牺牲了正常生活，来防止病毒向外蔓延。同时，全国3万多名医护人员和大量生活医疗物资进入湖北。在这一罕见的非常时期，湖北社会秩序维持稳定，人民生活得以保障。 (truncated)","true","true","fb","2020-02-26T16:18:12.000Z","244605609584133_498326564212035","Our Spokesperson comments posted on February 25 invited debates from many people including Mr Bilahari.

Recently, Ambassador Dragan Jacimovic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to North Macedonia sent a letter of support to Ambassador Zhang Zuo, conveying the strong confidence of the Serbian Member of the Presidency of BiH, H.E. Milorad Dodik, in the Chinese government and people to overcome the outbreak, and BiH’s firm support for China's fight against the outbreak. Ambassador Jacimovic said in his letter that during his recent visit to North Macedonia, H.E. Milorad Dodik had discussed with him about the outbreak in China. The determination and efforts of the Chinese government to fight the outbreak were truly impressive. They both agreed that China will come out of this outbreak even stronger. Ambassador Jacimovic said that true international cooperation can help in overcoming challenges at this moment, and BiH would like to offer their support and help to China. Ambassador Zhang Zuo said in his letter of appreciation that his heartfelt appreciation goes to His Excellency Milorad Dodik, Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and His Excellency Dragan Jacimovic for their support of the Chinese government and people's fight against the outbreak and their sympathy and condolences to the victims and their families. Ambassador Zhang would like to express his sincere thanks to the friendly government and people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ambassador Zhang Zuo pointed out that under the strong leadership of President Xi Jinping, the 1.4 billion Chinese people are making all-out efforts in fighting the novel coronavirus disease，setting a speed record of treating patients and benchmark for global epidemic prevention and control, and demonstrating the sense of responsibility of China as a major country. The outbreak poses a challenge to the economic and social development of China. But its impact on China's economy is temporary. The long-term positive trend of China's economy will not change. We are confident in meeting economic and social development goals of this year. Ambassador Zhang Zuo stressed that after this test, all countries will realize that we are living in a global village and our destinies are closely connected. We should actively carry out international cooperation in epidemic prevention and control from the perspective of building a community for mankind with a shared future. China will continue to strengthen cooperation with all countries including BiH and North Macedonia in an open and transparent manner to jointly deal with the epidemic and promote the health and well-being of people all around the world. The friendship between the peoples of China and BiH as well as North Macedonia will continue to deepen.

The student said: “I have stayed in my dorm since the inception of this outbreak. We are told not to go outside, but I know this is to prevent us from being exposed to the virus.” The student also mentioned that all the Botswana students in Wuhan have received care and help from their universities.

They also have internet, WeChat app and Whatsapp for accessing the latest information and keeping in touch with family and friends. Ambassador Zhao emphasized that putting the life and health of Chinese and foreign nationals in the country as the first priority, the Chinese government is doing its best to care for Botswana students in China as its own and make sure they have all they need during their study in China. Ambassador Zhao said: “I am, like your parents, following the development of the epidemic every day and paying close attention to your status. Till today, the number of new confirmed cases outside Hubei has seen a 10-day decline. Cure rates have kept rising. And more and more patients have been cured and discharged from hospital. These figures and facts show that the epidemic is totally controllable and curable. As new effective drugs are being developed, Please rest assured that China has every confidence, capacity and determination to win a full victory against the epidemic very soon.” Ambassador Zhao also encouraged the student to stay brave and face the epidemic bravely by following the guidance from local authorities and the university. He advised all the Botswana students in Wuhan to take preventative measures such as washing hands frequently, wearing a mask outdoors and staying away from unnecessary gathering in order to avoid cross infection. “Do take good care of yourselves”, Ambassador Zhao said.","true","true","fb","2020-02-14T16:28:47.000Z","838988326148968_2728324403882008","Chinese Ambassador Dr. Zhao Yanbo Encourages Botswana Student in Wuhan to Face the Epidemic Bravely On 13th February 2020, Chinese Ambassador H.E.
